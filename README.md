Climate Resilience in Subsistence Farming
Definition
Climate resilience in subsistence farming refers to the capacity of small-scale farmers to adapt to, withstand, and recover from the adverse effects of climate change while maintaining or improving their agricultural productivity and livelihood.

Key Aspects
Adaptation: Implementing strategies to mitigate climate risks, such as drought-resistant crops or improved irrigation methods.
Sustainability: Ensuring the farming methods conserve resources like soil, water, and biodiversity for future generations.
Diversification: Introducing mixed cropping, agroforestry, and alternative income sources to reduce dependency on a single crop.
Community Engagement: Collaborative efforts like water-sharing agreements, seed banks, and local knowledge sharing for climate-smart practices.
Technology Integration: Using weather forecasts, mobile apps, or IoT for real-time data on soil, rainfall, and crop conditions.
Example Initiatives
Crop Rotation: Shifting crops seasonally to maintain soil health.
Rainwater Harvesting: Collecting and storing rainwater for irrigation during dry spells.
Resilient Crop Varieties: Using genetically engineered or indigenous varieties that resist extreme temperatures, pests, or flooding.
