Climate Resilience in Subsistence Farming
Definition
Climate resilience in subsistence farming refers to the capacity of small-scale farmers to adapt to, withstand, and recover from the adverse effects of climate change while maintaining or improving their agricultural productivity and livelihood.

Key Aspects
Adaptation: Implementing strategies to mitigate climate risks, such as drought-resistant crops or improved irrigation methods.
Sustainability: Ensuring the farming methods conserve resources like soil, water, and biodiversity for future generations.
Diversification: Introducing mixed cropping, agroforestry, and alternative income sources to reduce dependency on a single crop.
Community Engagement: Collaborative efforts like water-sharing agreements, seed banks, and local knowledge sharing for climate-smart practices.
Technology Integration: Using weather forecasts, mobile apps, or IoT for real-time data on soil, rainfall, and crop conditions.
Example Initiatives
Crop Rotation: Shifting crops seasonally to maintain soil health.
Rainwater Harvesting: Collecting and storing rainwater for irrigation during dry spells.
Resilient Crop Varieties: Using genetically engineered or indigenous varieties that resist extreme temperatures, pests, or flooding.
1. Simple Weather Data Integration for Crop Planning
Python script to fetch weather data for advising farmers on planting dates.
2. Crop Yield Prediction Based on Climate Data
This example uses machine learning to predict yields based on climate parameters like rainfall, temperature, and soil moisture.
3. Community Resilience Dashboard
Using a web app like Flask or Django to display key climate resilience metrics for farmers.
